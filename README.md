In this project I was to create a timed quiz on Javascript Fundamentals that stores high scores.
The quiz should include:

* A start button that triggers a timer countdown and presents a question

* When one question is answered then another question is presented

* When a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock

* The game terminates when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

* When the game is over the player is able to enter their intials and see score


I am still working on getting this to work but decided to submit what I have. 
Screenshot and links will be updated on completion.
